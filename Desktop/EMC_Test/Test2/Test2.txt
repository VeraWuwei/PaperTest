Design test cases for a storage array. The array has the following functionalities: 
，        Create one or multiple LUN¨s.
，        Resize (expand) a LUN.
，        Export a LUN to a host.
，        Un-export a LUN.
，        Remove an un-exported LUNs.
，        Retrieve the information (size, export) of a LUN.
，        Concurrent requests is supported.
，        Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUN¨s are created and exported.


TC01: Create one or multiple LUNs
Objective: One or multiple LUNs can be created successfully
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Go to LUN creation page or go to the project folder with CLI;
                2. Add LUN with LUN name in right/wrong format;
                3. Try LUN size (from 1G to as large as possible);
                4. Choose target group/initiator groups;
                5. Choose/Not choose the attribute (such as thin provision);
                6. Check if LUNs can be listed.
Expected results:
                LUN creation page can be opened; Wrong format of LUN name/out of space size will be warned; 
               LUNs can be listed with right name,size and attributes.

TC02: Resize (expand) a LUN
Objective: LUN size can be modified successfully
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Select a LUN and go to edition page or use one command with options;
                2. Modify the size of this LUN in different size;
                3. Check the LUN list.
Expected results:
               LUNs can be listed with right name,size and attributes.

TC03: Export a LUN to a host
Objective: LUN can be exported to a host
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Host platform: Linux/Unix/Windows
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Select a LUN  or use one command with options;
                2. Attach it to a host;
                3. Try to attach to non-existing host;
                4. Check on the host and LUN's configuration.
Expected results:
               LUNs can be exported successfully and host can see the LUN with right name/size.
               Invalid hosts can be warnning

TC04: un-export a LUN
Objective: LUN can be un-exported from a host
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Host platform: Linux/Unix/Windows
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Select a LUN  or use one command with options;
                2. Dis-attach it from a host;
                3. Try to un-export it when there is data flow;
                4. Check on the host and LUN's configuration.
Expected results:
               LUNs can be un-exported successfully and host can't see any LUNs or the warning message should be shown during the LUN is being used.

TC05: Remove an un-exported LUNs
Objective: LUN can be un-exported from a host
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Select a LUN  or use one command with options;
                2. Dis-attach it to a host;
                3. Check on the host and LUN's configuration.
Expected results:
               LUNs can be exported successfully and host can see the LUN with right name/size.

TC06:  Retrieve the information (size, export) of a LUN
Objective:Retrieve the information of a LUN
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Host platform: Linux/Unix/Windows
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Check the Select a LUN  or use one command with options;
                2. Take Retrieve action by size/export info;
                3. Check the result.
Expected results:
               Retrieving the information of a LUN can be successfully .

TC07:   Concurrent requests is supported
Objective: Verity that concurrent requests is supported
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Create: try to create multiple LUNs at same time or with the same name on different platforms;
                2. Resize: try to resize multiple LUNs at same time on different platforms ;
                3. Export: try to export LUNs at same time on different platforms ;
                4. Un-export: try to un-export LUNs at same time on different platforms ;
                5. Delete: try to delete LUNs at same time on different platforms ;
                6. Check the result.
Expected results:
             All concurrent requests can be supported without any error. 
             For the same operation on one LUN, only one of the task will succeed.

TC08:   Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUN¨s are created and exported
Objective: Verity that performance is not impacted when load is heavy
Tools : Loadrunner or curl_loader(for Linux)
Setup: UI , CLI
Storage platform: Storage Version
Specail configuration: iSCSI, FC configuration
Procedures:
                1. Using  tool to simulate multi-threading to create/export LUNs;
                2. Check the performance of tool
 Expected results:
               Performance should NOT be impacted heavily.
